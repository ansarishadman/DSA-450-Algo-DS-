# List

1. Reverse the array | Time Complexity => O(n)
2. Find the maximum and minimum element in an array | Time Complexity => O(n)
3. Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array | Time Complexity => O(n)
4. Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo | Time Complexity => O(n)
5. Move all the negative elements to one side of the array | Time Complexity => O(n) | Auxiliary Space => O(1)
6. Find the Union and Intersection of the two sorted arrays. | Time Complexity => O(m + n)
7. Write a program to cyclically rotate an array by one. | Time Complexity => O(n) | Auxiliary Space => O(1)
